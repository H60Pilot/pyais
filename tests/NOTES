Create AIS Transmitted SAR Pattern:

Concept is to use HTML page to read the SAR OPS plan to
build the dict file. 

Send Dict to python PYAIS to encode the AIS message
    1. build the payload IAW IDD
    2. create the NEMA sentance
    3. return NEMA sentance to page???  

Copy NEMA to another page which will send sentance to
hard coded Base station(s).

Use MSG 26 FID xx
